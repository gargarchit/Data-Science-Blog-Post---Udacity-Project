## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This code runs with Python version 3.* and requires some libraries, to install theses libraries you will need to execute:
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Data Science Nanodegree project. I have taken FIFA 20 player dataset from kaggle

Link: https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/fifa-20-complete-player-dataset

Here, I will focus on the questions below:

Q1: What's the ratio of total wages/ total potential for clubs. Which clubs are the most spends most on player potentialï¼Ÿ

Q2: What's the age distribution like? How is it related to player's overall rating?

Q3: Predict the best position

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the [post]() available



## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Udacity courses for some of code ideas, and to kaggle/AirBnb for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/fifa-20-complete-player-dataset).
